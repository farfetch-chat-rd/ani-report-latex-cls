## Introduction
The purpose of the ANI Report LaTeX repository is to provide a LaTeX template to aid researchers and project managers/coordinators in producing high-quality reports for the Portuguese National Agency for Innovation. This template is derived from [ERDC](https://ctan.org/pkg/erdc) and adapted to the ANI document structure.

## Usage
This template should be trivial for anyone familiar with LaTeX to use. Type `make` in the shell to generate the sample PDF. If an error occurs, please review the log to determine which packages are missing.
